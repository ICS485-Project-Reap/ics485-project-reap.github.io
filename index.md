# Inital Ideas

Initially, we all had came together with different ideas between an interactive story similar to Minecraft, a puzzle game of looking at diffent places and a 2D platformer as the basis. After our initial meeting, we had decided we could incorporate the main components of all our ideas into a 2D platformer. 

# Motivation

Our goal is to create a 2D platformer where as a person progresses through a scene, they encounter enemies and a boss to defeat to progress through the level to the next. 

# Development

There were several different steps in planning that were taken to ensure that everyone was on the same page throughout the development process.

## Parts of Game Sketch

To gain a sense of the overall game, the storyline, scene and functionality were mapped relative to world, seed/hook, emotion, goal, suspense, obstacle, interaction/feedback, rules and levels.

There was also the presentation of different ways the players functionality could be implemented.

## Updated Parts of Game



## Storyline 

Basic Output Story of the Game:

Protagonist name: Mikhael?
Masters' name: Darrius and Elena (Married Couple)

Getter: In a nation, reaped with chaos, despair and hopelessness, will your blade carve a new destiny, or fall victim to the threads of fate?

In a nation gripped by revolutionary fervor and untamed warfare, you are an indentured servant whose fate was nearly sealed on the bloodstained fields of your crumbling farm. From the farmlands that gave you life and hope now destroyed by the everlasting tides of war, ruining everything you once called home. Your only respite now is to move to the capitol, where all people live free from the tyranny of the leaders.

Hoping that one day you will find peace, freedom and revert back to the better life you once knew, you embark on the journey that will either empower or enfeeble you. Armed with your battered scythe - a symbol of both hope and freedom and the inevitable harvest of change, you represent your power amongst the encroaching forces of the Anti-Revolution army. As you fight these forces a mysterious power, unlike anything you have ever experienced controls your every movement. A balanced harmony, a swift strike, a sure end. The Flow State, a fleeting surge that lets you leap between enemies with surgical precision. Yet with every chain of perfectly timed strikes, the pressure mounts, the window to execute the next decisive blow narrows, echoing the tightening grip of a nation in upheaval.

As you traverse battle-scarred territories, your journey becomes an unforeseen catalyst. Every enemy vanquished, every move made in the heat of combat shifts the very heart of the government - an ever-moving capitol, which houses the revolutionary headquarters, serves to be slightly out of reach for the protagonist, dragging with them a sense of despair to not get this amnesty. With your ever-building courage, proceed with determination and fight to gain your right for freedom.

Encountering diverse footmen, powerful leaders, generals, lieutenants, and ultimate tyrants, you carve your destiny and shape a path for a future that would never have been thought to been accomplished by a servant such as yourself. In chaotic crucible of war, loyalty, and fate, your solitary battle becomes a test of precision, resolve, and the haunting realization that sometimes the greatest enemies lie within yourself. Rebel against the head, step into your Flow, and decide whether you will be the liberator that reclaims the nations soul, or the inadvertent harbinger of its downfall.

## 2D Platformer Inspiration

As a piece of inspiration, one of the levels from shovel night was analyzed.

## Level Design 

As the player progresses through the levels there are obstacles that are necessary to overcome.

## Background Design 

There were several backgrounds created each made up of several layers. Additional layers to be layered on top was also created to create differences in the scences. In the images below contain some example of the scenes and the possibly scenes that could be created with the different layers.

# Project Management

All communication was on discord and meetings were once a week to assign tasks. The [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/PGbFmQW9/game-design-spring-2025) was used to keep a record of overall progress.
