# Inital Ideas

Initially, we all had came together with different ideas between an interactive story similar to Minecraft, a puzzle game of looking at diffent places and a 2D platformer as the basis. After our initial meeting, we had decided we could incorporate the main components of all our ideas into a 2D platformer. 

# Motivation

Our goal is to create a 2D platformer where as a person progresses through a scene, they encounter enemies and a boss to defeat to progress through the level to the next. 

# Development

## Parts of Game Sketch

To gain a sense of the overall game, the storyline, scene and functionality were mapped relative to world, seed/hook, emotion, goal, suspense, obstacle, interaction/feedback, rules and levels.

There was also the presentation of different ways the players functionality could be implemented.
