# Inital Ideas

Initially, we all had came together with different ideas between an interactive story similar to Minecraft, a puzzle game of looking at diffent places and a 2D platformer as the basis. After our initial meeting, we had decided we could incorporate the main components of all our ideas into a 2D platformer. 

# Motivation

Our goal is to create a 2D platformer where as a person progresses through a scene, they encounter enemies and a boss to defeat to progress through the level to the next. 

# Development

## Parts of Game Sketch

To gain a sense of the overall game, the storyline, scene and functionality were mapped relative to world, seed/hook, emotion, goal, suspense, obstacle, interaction/feedback, rules and levels.

There was also the presentation of different ways the players functionality could be implemented.

## Updated Parts of Game


## Storyline 

## 2D Platformer Inspiration

As a piece of inspiration, one of the levels from shovel night was analyzed.

## Updated Functionality



## Location 


## Level Design 

As the player progresses through the levels there are obstacles that are necessary to overcome.

## Background Design 

There were several backgrounds created each made up of several layers. Additional layers to be layered on top was also created to create differences in the scences. In the images below contain some example of the scenes and the possibly scenes that could be created with the different layers.

# Project Management

All communication was on discord and meetings were once a week to assign tasks. The [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/PGbFmQW9/game-design-spring-2025) was used to keep a record of overall progress.
