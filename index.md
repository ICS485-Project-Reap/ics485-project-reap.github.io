# Inital Ideas

Initially, we all had came together with different ideas between an interactive story similar to Minecraft, a puzzle game of looking at diffent places and a 2D platformer. After our initial meeting, we had decided we could incorporate the main components of all our ideas into a 2D platformer. 

# Motivation

Our goal is to create a 2D platformer where as a person progresses through a scene, they encounter and defeat enemies and a boss to progress through the levels. 

# Development

There were several different steps in planning that were taken to ensure that everyone was on the same page throughout the development process.

## Parts of Game Sketch

To gain a sense of the overall game, the storyline, scene and functionality were mapped relative to world, seed/hook, emotion, goal, suspense, obstacle, interaction/feedback, rules and levels.

There was also the presentation of the different ways the players functionality could be implemented.

## Storyline 

The outline of the story centered in Japan with trying to defeat enemies that the individual encounters

<details>
Protagonist name: Mikhael
Masters' name: Darrius and Elena (Married Couple)

Getter: In a nation, reaped with chaos, despair and hopelessness, will your blade carve a new destiny, or fall victim to the threads of fate?

In a nation gripped by revolutionary fervor and untamed warfare, you are an indentured servant whose fate was nearly sealed on the bloodstained fields of your crumbling farm. From the farmlands that gave you life and hope now destroyed by the everlasting tides of war, ruining everything you once called home. Your only respite now is to move to the capitol, where all people live free from the tyranny of the leaders.

Hoping that one day you will find peace, freedom and revert back to the better life you once knew, you embark on the journey that will either empower or enfeeble you. Armed with your battered scythe - a symbol of both hope and freedom and the inevitable harvest of change, you represent your power amongst the encroaching forces of the Anti-Revolution army. As you fight these forces a mysterious power, unlike anything you have ever experienced controls your every movement. A balanced harmony, a swift strike, a sure end. The Flow State, a fleeting surge that lets you leap between enemies with surgical precision. Yet with every chain of perfectly timed strikes, the pressure mounts, the window to execute the next decisive blow narrows, echoing the tightening grip of a nation in upheaval.

As you traverse battle-scarred territories, your journey becomes an unforeseen catalyst. Every enemy vanquished, every move made in the heat of combat shifts the very heart of the government - an ever-moving capitol, which houses the revolutionary headquarters, serves to be slightly out of reach for the protagonist, dragging with them a sense of despair to not get this amnesty. With your ever-building courage, proceed with determination and fight to gain your right for freedom.

Encountering diverse footmen, powerful leaders, generals, lieutenants, and ultimate tyrants, you carve your destiny and shape a path for a future that would never have been thought to been accomplished by a servant such as yourself. In chaotic crucible of war, loyalty, and fate, your solitary battle becomes a test of precision, resolve, and the haunting realization that sometimes the greatest enemies lie within yourself. Rebel against the head, step into your Flow, and decide whether you will be the liberator that reclaims the nations soul, or the inadvertent harbinger of its downfall.

## 2D Platformer Inspiration

As a piece of inspiration, one of the levels from shovel night was analyzed.

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/progress_pics/2d_platformer_inspiration.png">

</div>

## Updated Functionality

As the functionality is detailed and the storyline is going to be primarily communicated through semantics - the functionality was further revised and updated.

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/progress_pics/functionality_2.jpg">

</div>

## Location 

With the inspiration of flowers, this led to the consideration of context to be in Japan as the cherry blossoms are beautiful. Therefore, as a person is traveling through the scene the goal was to see different places and therefore the Nakasendo road plays a role in creating storyline as a person travels.

</div>

## Level Design 

As the player progresses through the levels there are obstacles that are necessary to overcome. Below is Level 1 and 2 seperately in the details tab.

</div>
</details>

## Background Design 

There were several backgrounds created each made up of several layers. Additional layers were used to create differences in the scences. In the images in the details section contain examples of the possible scenes that could be made with the layers.

# Asset Creation

## Character Design

The character was developed with the idea that the person was a traveler. The details tab below includes the draft design.

<details>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/progress_pics/character_colored_in.png">
</div>

</details>

## Character Sprite

The character designs were then translated to pixel art. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/final_pics/player_sprite.png">
</div>

## Enemies Designs Draft

The first draft of enemies were based on simple designs that are cammoflauged with the background.

<details>
The idea behind the enemies is that they are similar to a blob or a slimey thing that moves around in the scene. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/progress_pics/enemies_designs.png">
</div>
</details>

## Final Enemy Sprite

The final game sprites were completed with the inspiration of soldiers being the enemies. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/final_pics/enemy_sprite.png">
</div>


## Bosses Designs

### Draft 1

The design of these drafts were based on simple enemies.

<details>
The idea behind the boss designs is that they have multiple different colors to give an emotion that they are similar to a combination of all the enemies that they encountered

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/progress_pics/boss_designs.png">

</div>

</details>

### Draft 2
These designs were inspired by Lieuteants. 



## Attack Options

There were three proposed concepts for the attack for the enemies as shown in details. The animation for the attack that was chosen was Option 2.

<details>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/progress_pics/options_attacks.png">

</div>

</details>


Below is the Sprite sheet for the animation of the Attack

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="/final_pics/attack_sprite.png">

</div>

</details>

## Flow State Attack

The flow state attack is when the player gets a certain amount of point and then has the potential to activate. The flow state attack is similar to a special move that does more damage. The concept is shown in the details follwoed by the GIF of the motion.

<details>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

<img src="/progress_pics/playerFlowTest.gif" width="200" height="200" />

</details>

This is the flow state in the Sprite version.

# Project Management

All communication was on discord and meetings were once a week to assign tasks. The [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/PGbFmQW9/game-design-spring-2025) was used to keep a record of overall progress.
